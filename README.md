## Around the World... In A Few Keystrokes!

Description: This full-stack MERN application allows users to access information on any country in the world. 

[Back-end/API Repo](https://github.com/arjunrawal07/Around-the-World-API) 

### Technologies Used: 
* Front End: React, CSS
* Back End: MongoDB, Express, Node.js

### Features:

This application features allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) country profile information. 

### Challenges: 

While building this application, I thought carefully about how to construct my data models in the backend. I realized early on in the development process that how I built my data models would affect my ability to access data from my API. This challenege proved to be a valuable learning moment because I had to apply similar concepts when working on subsequent projects that managed and accessed data.

### Future Iterations: 

As I continue to build on this application, I will:
* Add authentication settings so only certain users can edit, delete, and create country profiles.
* Add images to each country.
* Add search functionality so users can search for country information using a language as the search field.
